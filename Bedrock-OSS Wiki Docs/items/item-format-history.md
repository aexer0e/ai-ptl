    -   Contains `delay` which determines the duration (in ticks) before kinetic damage and effects start to be applied.
    -   Contains `hitbox_margin` which determines how close (in blocks) each target's collision needs to be to the player's view direction to be affected by the kinetic attack.
        -   By default, there is no additional hitbox margin.
    -   Contains `reach` which determines the range (in blocks) of how far away entities must be from the player in order to be affected by the kinetic attack.
