No need to panic! This page will help debug common issues.

## 1.0 - Texture Troubleshooting

Fix issues related to block textures.

## 1.1 - Texture is Black and Magenta

I will be reviewing three different types of blocks that have different layouts: Dirt-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_dirt.png), Log-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_log.png), Grass-like ![](/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/tr_grass.png)

Navigate to your `RP/textures/terrain_texture.json`. Ensure that the file is properly named.

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/terrain_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "resource_pack_name": "wiki",
    "texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
    "texture_data": {
        "wiki:dirt_like": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        },
        "wiki:custom_log_top": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_log_top" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        },
        "wiki:custom_log_side": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_log_side" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        },
        "wiki:custom_grass_top": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_top" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        },
        "wiki:custom_grass_bottom": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_bottom" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        },
        "wiki:custom_grass_side": {
            "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_side" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
        }
    }
}
```

Next, navigate to your block file. In your block file, make sure you have the `material_instances` component.

Dirt like block example:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/dirt_like.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.21.120",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:dirt_like"
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "wiki:dirt_like"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Log like block example:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/custom_log.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.21.120",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:custom_log"
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "wiki:custom_log_side"
                },
                "end": {
                    "texture": "wiki:custom_log_top"
                },
                "up": "end",
                "down": "end"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Grass-like block example:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/custom_grass.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.21.120",
    "minecraft:block": {
        "description": {
            "identifier": "wiki:custom_grass"
        },
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_side"
                },
                "up": {
                    "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_top"
                },
                "down": {
                    "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_bottom"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you followed this properly, your block should now have correct texture.

## 1.2 - Texture Displays "?" on Dirt

Problem: My custom block has turned into a dirt block with a question mark on it.

<WikiImage
    src="/assets/images/blocks/block_tr/unknown.png"
    pixelated="true"
    width="128"
    class="my-4"
/>

This an `unknown` block, which appears when the block identifier is changed or if your block JSON invalid.

Solution: Use a JSON linter and double check that your identifier didn't change. Ensure that your block has `minecraft:geometry` and `minecraft:material_instances`, or an `RP/blocks.json` textures entry.

## 2.0 - Rendering Troubleshooting

This section will describe common block rendering issues and how to fix them.

## 2.1 - Transparency isn't Working

Problem: You have transparent pixels in your texture file, but when applied in-game, they become opaque.

Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your `material_instances` component. Add the following to your component:

<CodeHeader>BP/blocks/your_block.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "format_version": "1.21.120",
    "minecraft:block": {
        ...
        "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                    "render_method": "alpha_test"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 2.2 - Block Creates Shadows

Problem: You have block with custom geometry but it has a shadow.

Solution: Add following component to your block's code:

<CodeHeader>minecraft:block > components</CodeHeader>

```json
"minecraft:light_dampening": 0
```

## 3.0 - Common Content Log Errors

This section will describe common content log errors and how to debug them.

## 3.1 - Collision/Selection Box Errors

Problem: You get a content error similar to:

> `[Blocks][error]-minecraft:collision_box: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)`

Solution: Check your `minecraft:collision_box` or `minecraft:selection_box` components and do the following:

-   Make sure the X and Z values are from `-8`{lang=json} to `8`{lang=json}.
-   Make sure the Y value is from `0`{lang=json} to `16`{lang=json}.
-   Make sure the box doesn't exit the block's 16&times;16&times;16 unit area.

## 3.2 - Model Errors

Problem: You get a content error similar to:

> `geometry.your_block contains X boxes outside...`

Solution: Your geometry is bigger than Minecraft blocks allow. You can either make the geometry smaller or split it into multiple blocks.
