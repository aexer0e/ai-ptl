## 1.21.130

### Components

<Tag name="experimental" />
<Label color="blue">Upcoming Creator Features</Label>

-   Added `minecraft:leashable`
    -   Allows leads to be attached to the block like fences.
    -   Contains `offset` which determines the position of the middle of the knot relative to the bottom middle of the block.
-   Added `minecraft:support`
    -   Defines the block's ability to support other blocks that are attached to it.
    -   Contains `shape` which may be set to `"fence"`{lang=json} or `"stair"`{lang=json}.
-   Updated `minecraft:material_instances`
    -   Removed redundant `emissive` instance parameter

<Tag name="experimental" />
<Label color="blue">Upcoming Creator Features</Label>
<Label color="green">Versioned</Label>

-   Updated `minecraft:collision_box`
    -   Can now be defined as an array of multiple boxes.

## 1.21.120

### Components

-   Released `minecraft:embedded_visual` from experimental
-   Released `minecraft:flower_pottable` from experimental
-   Released `minecraft:redstone_producer` from experimental
-   Updated `minecraft:material_instances`
    -   Released [texture variation](/blocks/block-texture-variation) support for `texture` instance parameter from experimental.

<Tag name="experimental" />
<Label color="blue">Upcoming Creator Features</Label>
<Label color="green">Versioned</Label>

-   Added `minecraft:precipitation_interactions`
    -   Determines how this block interacts with precipitation (rain and snow).
    -   Contains `precipitation_behavior` which can be one of the following values:
        -   `obstruct_rain_accumulate_snow` (default) prevents rain from passing through the block, instead splashing on top of it and causes snow layers to build up above the block if it is snowing.
        -   `obstruct_rain` prevents rain from passing through the block, instead splashing on top of it.
        -   `none` allows rain and snow to pass through the block.
-   Updated `minecraft:material_instances`
    -   Added `alpha_masked_tint` instance parameter which determines whether the intensity of the tint applied by [tint methods](/blocks/block-tinting#tint-methods) should be based on the alpha channel of the texture.
        -   This requires a `tint_method` to be specified (that is not `none`) as well as a `render_method` of `opaque`.
    -   Added `emissive` instance parameter which determines whether faces using the material instance should have no shading (disabling face dimming and ambient occlusion).
        -   Note that this parameter does not cause faces to be displayed at full brightness at all times.

    -   Causes the block to produce redstone power.
    -   Contains `power` which determines the power level produced by the block as an integer (0-15).
    -   Contains `connected_faces` which determines which directions power is produced in.
        -   Defined as an array of faces which may include `down`, `up`, `north`, `south`, `west` and `east`.
        -   By default, all faces are connected.
    -   Contains `strongly_powered_face` which determines the direction where strong power is produced.
        -   If strong power is received by a [redstone conductor](/blocks/block-components#redstone-conductivity), blocks surrounding the conductor will be powered (connected to the circuit).
        -   By default, no face is strongly powered.
    -   Contains `transform_relative` which determines whether face directions should be relative to the `rotation` value in the [transformation](/blocks/block-components#transformation) component.
        -   By default, faces are not transform-relative.

        -   `steps` which determines how many equally-spaced random values can be chosen across the `range`.
            -   A value of `0` means that any value within the `range` can be used.
