Although custom blocks are unable to make use of vanilla [block shapes](/blocks/block-shapes), Mojang provides several `minecraft` namespaced models that replicate their look!

:::danger HARDCODED
Currently, vanilla block models are not data-driven, so cannot be modified nor found as JSON files in the vanilla resource pack.

This also means that they are not compatible with the `bone_visibility` and `culling` parameters of the [geometry](/blocks/block-components#geometry) component.

## Applying Vanilla Models

Vanilla block models are applied in the same way as [custom block models](/blocks/block-models), using the [geometry](/blocks/block-components#geometry) component, with textures defined in [material instances](/blocks/block-components#material-instances):

<CodeHeader>minecraft:block > components</CodeHeader>

```json
"minecraft:geometry": "minecraft:geometry.full_block",
"minecraft:material_instances": {
    "*": {
        "texture": "cobblestone"
    }
}
```
